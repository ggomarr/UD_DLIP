# Udemy Deep Learning in Python Jupyter notebooks

Thеsе notebooks contain the code used to follow the Deep Learning in Python course offered by Udemy (as of 2017-06-21).

Additional data files would be needed to make all of them work:
- A file with data regarding an e-commerce site
- A copy of the Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge dataset, which was downloaded [from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)

These were too large to be added to the repository.
